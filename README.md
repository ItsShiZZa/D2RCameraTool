# D2RCameraTool

Discord: __shizza__ ("shizza" surrounded by double underscores)

Diablo II: Resurrected - mod camera values (angles and zoom) in memory - change camera perspective
Cheat Engine table included as well (.CT file)

Working as of D2R version 1.6.77312

DO NOT USE IN MULTIPLAYER OR YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE BANNED. FOR SINGLE PLAYER MODE USE ONLY.

This project uses an open source library called Memory.dll found at https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll/
I've noticed this library can cause false positives on virus scans.
If this tool causes a positive result this library is likely why.

If you have any concerns just use the Cheat Engine table (.CT file) contained within
