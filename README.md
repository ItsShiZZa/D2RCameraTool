# D2RCameraTool
Diablo II: Resurrected - mod camera values (angles and zoom) in memory - change camera perspective

This project uses an open source library called Memory.dll found at https://github.com/erfg12/memory.dll/
I've noticed this library can cause false positives on virus scans.
If this tool causes a positive result this library is likely why.

If you have any concerns just use the Cheat Engine table (.CT file) contained within
